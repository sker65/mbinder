# extract attachments from mbox files

small python script to extract attachments from mbox files (e.g. google gmail takeout)

## improvements

compared the the fork it has a simple filter option to only extract files with a
specfic extension e.g. only PDFs.

I also added a filename decoration with message date for import into paperles-ngx
